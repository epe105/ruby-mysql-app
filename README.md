# What This Is
With integrated pipelines being a great new feature (albeit in tech preview status currently) released with OpenShift 3.3, I wanted to put together an easy way for folks to try it out beyond the simplistic example that's included OOTB. This example takes a php application and promotes dev builds across multiple environments automatically, while also asking the user for approval input before deploying into each higher level environment. The flow is as follows:

> 1. Execute the build pipeline
> 2. A new build and deploy executes in the dev environment
> 3. The pipeline asks for approval prior to promoting to QA
> 4. The pipeline deploys to the QA environment upon approval
> 5. The pipeline asks for approval prior to promoting to Production
> 6. The pipeline deploys to the Production environment upon approval

In order to use this example, you just need an OpenShift instance and the oc client tool.

# How To Set This Up
+ You need internet connectivity for this... I'm working on making this completely offline, so more to come there.
+ Fork this repo. You'll want to be able to make code changes and roll them out across environments.
+ __Edit and commit__ the _php-bluegreen-app-pipeline-bc.yml_ file so that the git uri on line 10 points to your fork.
+ __Edit and commit__ the _pipeline-setup.sh_ file such that on lines 7 and 10, you're pointing to your fork. Again note that I'm pointing to a specific branch whereas you may not.
+ __Edit and commit__ the _Jenkinsfile_ on line 23, provide your specific ip/host:port and login information
+ Clone your repository locally (note again that this is a branch)

```
git clone https://github.com/tariq-islam/bluegreen -b ocp33-pipeline
```

+ Similar a previous step, you can uncomment out line #5 in the _pipeline-setup.sh_ file and provide your specific ip/host:port and login information, or simply oc login before running the setup script.
+ Run the pipeline-setup.sh script (don't forget to change permissions on the file to make it executable)

```
./pipeline-setup.sh
```

+ Check your OpenShift environment. The script should have set up three projects for you (App Dev, App QA, and App Production).
+ Check out the Overview for the App Dev project, the script should have provisioned the following:
	+ A Jenkins (ephemeral) instance (credentials are _admin/password_)
	+ An initial deployment of your fork of the bluegreen php application

+ Click on _Builds --> Pipelines_, and you should see a pipeline already configured. Feel free to look through its configuration and note that it's pointing to the Jenkinsfile that's part of your repository.
+ Click on _Start Pipeline_ at the top right of the _Pipelines_ screen. The pipeline will begin to run and will walk you through the workflow as described above, asking for input/approval where necessary.

> One point of caution -- be sure that the Development build completes and the image is pushed into the repository _before_ you approve a deployment into QA or Prod. If you approve into QA or Prod before the newly built image is pushed into the registry from Dev, you'll end up with a bit of a race condition where QA and Prod simply redeploy the now older image.
